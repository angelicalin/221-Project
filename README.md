1. How to run this program?

   Please go to the KakuroProgram class and run it. It will present you a visualization of check board and the solution.


   In this game, we need to solve the values of the white cells, which add up to column sums and row sums in the pink cells.
   The blue cells are here for fun and beauty. They are neither solution cells nor sum cells.

   The program will first print the possible values for each emptcell. Then loops over the empty cells, and fill in the
   final solution. After it finishes solving, it will print "Solving Complete"
2. It stucked?
   
   Because the solver uses random shuffle, there is a possibility that it does not always get a solution. If such      thing happens, please restart the program.
